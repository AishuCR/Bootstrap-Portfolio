                                            My name is Gayathri and I am an Electrical Engineer. I did my Engineering in T.J Institute of technology, in India.
                                            While I was doing my Engineering I was not much interested in the computer programming languages and stuffs. After completing
                                             my course, I just attended a class to know how html and css is used in developing websites. When I joined the class I didn't 
                                             think that the web development will be so fun. When the classes started to reach CSS, it was more fun and that is when I decided 
                                             to learn the fullstack development.
                                             </div>
                                    
                                    <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-xl-12">
                                            
                                            After that I started to learn them through some online resouces and I tried to develop some website pages with just html and css and
                                            I also took some sample websites and tried to develop them. Later I wanted to develop my knowledge towards full stact development. 
                                            I was able to learn concepts of front end and try to implement them. Through online resources I wasn't sure whether am going through
                                            the right stuff and this made me join the University of Arizona Bootcamp.
